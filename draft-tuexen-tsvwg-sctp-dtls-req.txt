           Requirements for Securing SCTP Traffic using DTLS
                draft-tuexen-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-req-latest

Abstract

   The current specification of DTLS over SCTP is outdated and does not
   fulfill the requirements of 3GPP.  This Internet Draft documents the
   requirements of 3GPP for securing SCTP based communications using
   DTLS.  It is a result of a design team in TSVWG and reflects the
   current of its work.  Therefore, this document is expected to change
   over time.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on 17 June 2024.

1.  Introduction

   This document reflects the current status of a design team in TSVWG
   working on the requirements of securing SCTP based traffic using
   DTLS.

   The following people were participating the design team: Marcelo
   Ricardo Leitner, Xin Long, John Mattsson, Claudio Porfiri,
   Tirumaleswar Reddy.K, Zahed Sarker, Hannes Tschofenig, Michael Tüxen,
   and Magnus Westerlund.

2.  Functional Requirements for SCTP

   *  An SCTP implementation must support at least two streams used for
      reliable and in-sequence delivery.

   *  Message size of at least 1 GB must be supported.  It is known that
      currently user message size of 0.5 MB are in use.  Liaison
      statement from 3GPP RAN3 [LS-RAN3] stated "RAN3 would like to
      confirm our previous LS: we do not expect to limit the maximum
      message size of application protocols.  For this reason, any
      solution with a limit on message size will not meet RAN3
      requirements."

   *  Multihoming must be supported.  However, support or dynamic
      address reconfiguration as specified in [RFC5061] is not required.

   *  The restart procedure must be supported.

   *  Protocol mechanisms should not limit the availability of the
      communication (like the draining procedure in [RFC6083]).

3.  Implementation Considerations for SCTP

   *  User message sizes must not be limited by an protocol
      implementation (for example the size of send or receive buffers).

   *  For some it is preferred to be able to use open source kernel SCTP
      implementations.

4.  Security Requirements

   *  Mutual authentication must be used with periodic re-authentication
      allowing a certificate update.

   *  It must the possible to run DH once per hour or every 100GB.

   *  Privacy and integrity is required for user data.

   *  An on-path attacker being able to drop packets might be able to
      drop the association.

   *  An on-path attacker being able to replay messages, insert
      messages, or modify messages must not be able to affect the
      availability of the association or change user data.

   *  In particular, the SCTP restart procedure must not allow to take
      over an SCTP association by an attacker.

5.  Implementation Considerations for DTLS

   *  Focus on DTLS 1.3 only.

   *  For some it is preferred to use unmodified DTLS implementations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   No actions from IANA required.

7.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
